# 🔎 Find

A file finder made in rust

## ❓ Usage

```bash
find <FILE> <PATH>
```

Lets say we want to find all the files named `README.md` in the current directory. We can do that by running:

```bash
find README.md
```

If we want to search for a file in a specific directory, we can do that by running:

```bash
find README.md /path/to/directory
```
